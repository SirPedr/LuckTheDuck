# About Luck, the Duck
Luck, the Duck it's a discord bot that helps DM's finding details about a lot of monsters in D&D 5th edition so they can 
make combat more fluid and dynamic without having to check the Monster Manual everytime they wanna know something!

You cand add Luck to our server by clicking [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=702685014378414140&permissions=26624&scope=bot).
# Why?
As a DM running games on Discord, I know that sometimes checking the core books might take a while and is not the most
practical thing to do when you need information, and having _any_ tool that helps making the games more dynamic and fluid
it's really helpful. I'm trying to contribute to this community giving a little help regarding monsters. And man, monsters can
have a lot of information, so that's why I'm here!

# How to Use It?
Once the bot is up and running, it will try to respond to any messages that starts with `!luck`. Right now he'll do nothing if
can't match any command.

## Commands
Right now Luck has only one command:
- `!luck [monsterName]`: Gives details about a monster named `monsterName`.
  - If the search returns more than one result, Luck will give you a list of options instead. Just type the number associated to the
  monster you want.

## Additional Options
- `!private`: Return monster details in private. You know, so the players can't see what will fight them.
